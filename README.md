KSCrash
=======

#### The Ultimate iOS Crash Reporter

### Beta Note

Although it's now being shipped in production apps, KSCrash is still
officially considered "beta" software because there are a few more
enhancements I want to make before releasing version 1.0.

The following features are newer and not as tested as the rest:

- Recrash detection
- Interesting address detection in the stack and registers
- Zombie detection
- Crash Doctor 
- Deadlock detection

These features are being used in deployed systems, but have not had as much
exposure as the rest of the library.

Also, the backend side is not done yet, though Hockey and Quincy integration
is fully implemented and working (more on the way as time allows).


### Another crash reporter? Why?

Because all existing solutions fall short in some way:

* None of them handle stack overflow crashes.
* None of them fill in all fields for its Apple crash reports.
* Some don't symbolicate on the device.
* They only record enough information for an Apple crash report, though there
  is plenty of other useful information to be gathered!

As well, each crash reporter service, though most of them use PLCrashReporter
at the core, has its own format and API.

#### KSCrash is superior for the following reasons:

* It catches ALL crashes.
* Its pluggable server reporting architecture makes it easy to adapt to any API
  service (it already supports Hockey and Quincy and sending via email, with
  more to come!).
* It supports symbolicating on the device.
* It records more information about the system and crash than any other crash
  reporter.
* It is the only crash reporter capable of creating a 100% complete Apple crash
  report (including thread/queue names).
* It supports zombie detection in the wild.
* It can piece together objective-c method calls.
* It can detect deadlocks in the main thread.
* It provides extra contextual information to help you track down the cause of
  the crash.

### How to build it

1. Select the **KSCrash** scheme.
2. Choose **iOS Device**.
3. Select **Archive** from the **Products** menu.

When it has finished building, it will show you the framework in Finder. You
can use it like you would any other framework.


### How to use it

1. Add the framework to your project (or add the KSCrash project as a
   dependency)

2. Add the following to your **[application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:]**
   method in your app delegate:

.

    #import <KSCrash/KSCrash.h>
    // Include to use the standard reporter.
    #import <KSCrash/KSCrashReportSinkStandard.h>
    // Include to use Quincy or Hockey.
    #import <KSCrash/KSCrashReportSinkQuincy.h>

	- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*) application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary*) launchOptions
	{
    	id<KSCrashReportFilter> sink = [KSCrashReportSinkStandard sinkWithURL:myAPIURL onSuccess:nil];
	    // OR:
    	id<KSCrashReportFilter> sink = [KSCrashReportSinkHockey sinkWithAppIdentifier:hockeyAppID onSuccess:nil];
	    // OR:
    	id<KSCrashReportFilter> sink = [KSCrashReportSinkQuincy sinkWithURL:myQuincyURL onSuccess:nil];

	    [KSCrash installWithCrashReportSink:sink];
	    â€¦
	}

And you're done! If a crash occurs, it will store a report. Upon relaunch, it
will automatically contact the server and upload the report whenever the device has internet access.


Advanced Usage
--------------

### Enabling on-device symbolication

On-device symbolication requires basic symbols to be present in the final
build. To enable this, go to your app's build settings and set **Strip Style**
to **Debugging Symbols**. Doing so increases your final binary size by about
5%, but you get on-device symbolication.


### Passing extra information to the crash reporter

You can pass a dictionary to KSCrash, which will get stored to the "user_data"
portion of a crash report:

    [KSCrash installWithCrashReportSink:sink
                               userInfo:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                                         @"username", someUsername,
                                         nil]
                        zombieCacheSize:16384
               deadlockWatchdogInterval:5.0f
                     printTraceToStdout:NO
                                onCrash:nil];


### Passing extra info to the crash reporter during a crash

If you have extra information at crash time that would be useful on a crash
report, you can provide an **onCrash** function:

    static void onCrash(const KSReportWriter* writer)
    {
        writer->addStringElement(writer, "sprocketID", g_sprocketID);
    }
    
    - (void) installCrashHandler
    {
        [KSCrash installWithCrashReportSink:sink
                                   userInfo:nil
                         printTraceToStdout:YES
                                    onCrash:onCrash];
    }

**Warning**: onCrash will be called in a **crashed** context. This is a
**VERY DANGEROUS** state since for all we know the memory has been trampled
over and nothing's valid anymore. As well, calling any functions that create
locks could potentially deadlock, so you must
[only call async-safe functions](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/SIG30-C.+Call+only+asynchronous-safe+functions+within+signal+handlers).
**DO NOT CALL OBJECTIVE-C METHODS FROM THIS FUNCTION!!!**

It's generally best to avoid using this feature unless absolutely necessary.


### Deferring server reporting

If you don't want it to report to the server right away, you can pass nil as
the sink parameter:

    [KSCrash installWithCrashReportSink:nil];

It will still install the crash reporter, and will still record crashes, but it
won't attempt to report to an external API until you assign it a sink:

    #import <KSCrash/KSCrashAdvanced.h>

	[KSCrash instance].sink = [KSCrashReportSinkStandard sinkWithURL:myAPIURL onSuccess:nil];


KSCrashLite
-----------

KSCrashLite is intended for use in custom crash frameworks that have special needs. It doesn't
include any sinks (except for console); it is expected that the user will supply their own.
Unlike the regular KSCrash framework, KSCrashLite has no dependencies on MessageUI.framework or
zlib (it still requires SystemConfiguration.framework).


Examples
--------

The workspace includes two example apps, which demonstrate using KSCrash and
KSCrashLite.
